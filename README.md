A trivia game with questions about classical music. You will have thirty seconds to pick the correct answer out of four choices.

When the question is displayed a thirty second timer will begin. The answer you select will be indicated by the text being boldened as you hover. Each question will give you a response page indicating whether your guess was correct, incorrect, or if the time ran out. Correct answers will provide a fun fact. Incorrect answers will provide the correct response.

At the end of the quiz a result page will tell you the percentage of correct answers as well as indicate how many correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions with which you completed the quiz.
